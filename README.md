======

A pure JavaScript implementation of the AES block cipher algorithm and all common modes of operation (CBC, CFB, CTR, ECB and OFB).


Features
--------

- Pure JavaScript (with no dependencies)
- Supports all key sizes (128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit)
- Supports all common modes of operation (CBC, CFB, CTR, ECB and OFB)

API
===

All keys must be 128 bits (16 bytes), 192 bits (24 bytes) or 256 bits (32 bytes) long. The API's work on either arrays or `Buffer` objects.
